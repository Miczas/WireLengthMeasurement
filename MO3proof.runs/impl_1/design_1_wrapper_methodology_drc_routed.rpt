Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#10 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/measurement_system/controller_0/U0/generate_pulse_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/measurement_system/controller_0/U0/generate_pulse_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#11 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/measurement_system/controller_0/U0/reg_load_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/measurement_system/controller_0/U0/reg_load_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 11 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
